# EnginesGame

I am typically a developer when making a game, i chose the third developer option

The only third party code used is from Cinemachine in the unity registry for the camera. The DLLs were based off the Lab.

To swap DLLs in EnginesGame_Data/Plugins rename the current EnginesGameDLL.dll to something else and rename the one you want to use to EnginesGameDLL.dll and
