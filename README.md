# EnginesGame Lab 4

This is based on the game i used for assignment 1 and the practical midterm. 
An observer pattern is used to call sound effects by my bulletholder object. The player object calls it to fire and it manipulates the pool of 10 bullets and plays a sound.
A singleton pattern is used as I made a singleton script called global variables that holds the players health.
Also, the shooting sound is just my voice pitch shifted.
